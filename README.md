# HumanResources-Chatbot
project represents model of an HR chatbot with few functionalities of an HR like recruitment of new applicants, asking about policies and one internal function i.e. asking for leave.

We made this HR chatbot with two technologies - one with deep learning and other one without deep learning.

The one with name *hrbot.py* uses rasa nlu library and the other two files *model.py* and *responses.py* uses Tensorflow library with deep neural network.

1. You have to install all the packages given in the code using pip or you can also clone packages like rasa_nlu using git command.
2. Then, you have to create one database with table that contains holidays/leaves records of each employee.
3. You are all set, just hit run button.

FOR DEEP LEARNING CHATBOT - 
1. Run *model.py* to build model first.
2. Run *responses.py* to use the model and fetch responses.
